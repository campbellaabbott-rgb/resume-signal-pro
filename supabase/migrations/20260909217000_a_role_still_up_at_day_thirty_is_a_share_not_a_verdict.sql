-- A ROLE STILL UP AT DAY THIRTY IS A SHARE, NOT A VERDICT.
--
-- The owner asked for posting AGE to become a signal: the longer a posting is
-- up, the more likely, in their words, that the employer is not hiring for
-- it. Everything in this file is what that request can honestly mean on this
-- board, and nothing it cannot.
--
-- WHAT IS MEASURABLE. FRESH_WINDOW_DAYS is 30. Past day 30 a posting is not
-- observed, it is DELETED -- the sweep tombstones it into job_board_aged_out
-- and logs an 'aged_out' exit -- so a takedown after day 30 is never seen and
-- a lifetime past day 30 is unmeasurable at any sample size. That is the
-- refusal docs/hiring-health-model.md section 10 records and it stands: nothing
-- here extrapolates past the cap. The measurable quantity is S(30): the share
-- of a DATED cohort still advertised when it reaches the cap, with R(30) the
-- share taken down for good and X(30) the share re-listed. All three come from
-- the Aalen-Johansen estimator 20260909200000 already runs; this file extends
-- that estimator's OUTPUT and leaves every existing column byte-identical.
--
-- TWO THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE S(30) A LIE, AND WHAT STOPS EACH.
--
--   1. THE CENSORED ARM DID NOT EXIST BEFORE 2026-08-07. An age-out is the
--      observation that a role reached the cap without closing. Its origin,
--      job_board_exits.posted_at, is stamped only from 2026-09-06 and the rows
--      before that were hard-deleted, so a cohort posted before 2026-08-07 has
--      its takedowns in the log and its survivors NOWHERE: every hazard runs
--      high and S(30) runs low, in the accusing direction. The day-30 cohort
--      is therefore floored at GREATEST(the first whole day after now() - 90
--      days, 2026-08-07), with the
--      stamping date a named constant (EXITS_ORIGIN_STAMPED_FROM) and the floor
--      returned as cohort_from so a caption can print it. It retires itself:
--      on 2026-11-05 the 90-day window passes it and the GREATEST stops
--      binding, with no edit.
--
--   2. A BOARD WE CANNOT READ TO THE END HAS S(30) = 1 BY CONSTRUCTION. On a
--      board over the page cap with no completed lap we cannot see a takedown
--      at all, so every posting "ages out" and the estimator reports an
--      employer that never takes anything down -- exactly the shape the owner
--      would read as the signal firing. Measured live on 2026-09-10 (status
--      action, deployed 2026-09-09.67): deepCursor.laps tracking 505, proven
--      130, disarmed 14, firstLapAt 2026-09-09T15:09:37Z; get_closure_
--      population(): boards_full_read 43381, boards_lap_proven 125,
--      boards_lap_pending 378, boards_unprovable 117, boards_unobserved 304.
--      refresh_closure_population() already sorts every board into those
--      five buckets and then throws the per-board answer away, keeping only
--      the counts. 20260909217800 materialises it as
--      job_board_board_observability; this function reads that table and
--      publishes the day-30 columns as NULL -- not 1.0 -- unless the board's
--      bucket is full_read or lap_proven. observability_bucket says which.
--
-- WHAT IS PUBLISHED, PER EMPLOYER. still_open_30 with a complementary-log-log
-- interval (still_open_30_lo/hi, in this file's own form: v = min(gw/ln(S)^2,
-- 4), lo = S^min(exp(+1.96 sqrt v), 50), hi = S^max(exp(-1.96 sqrt v), 0.02)),
-- taken_down_30, relist_rate_30, n_at_risk_30 (observations that reached the
-- cap), ageouts_at_30 (the ones OUR sweep took down at the cap -- our action,
-- never an employer event), sum_check_30 (R + X + S, published so the identity
-- is CHECKED rather than asserted), cohort_from, cohort_to, and sufficient_30
-- (n_at_risk_30 >= 25, half-width <= 0.15, identity within 1e-6, bucket
-- admitted; the thresholds are named constants in the body).
--
-- THE DAY-30 COHORT IS THE COHORT THAT HAD THIRTY DAYS. cohort_to is thirty
-- days ago, so every member either closed, re-listed, aged out at the cap, is
-- still advertised past it, or was lost to a dark feed and censored early.
-- A posting younger than that could only enter as an early censoring, and
-- leaving it out lets the number be read as the sentence it renders as. The
-- day-14 curve keeps its own 90-day origin convention and is untouched.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT SAY. A closure never means hired. A role still advertised
-- at day 30 is not proof of anything about the employer beyond the fact
-- stated. taken_down_30 is a CEILING for the same relist-dedupe reason as
-- fill_rate_14, and relist_rate_30 the matching FLOOR. fill_rate_30, which
-- already existed, runs over the day-14 cohort with no observability gate and
-- is a different number on purpose; its meaning did not move.
--
-- WHY THIS IS ONE FUNCTION PER FILE. The OUT-parameter guard slices the newest
-- migration mentioning a function from its first $$ to its last; two functions
-- in one file fail it. 20260909217500 carries the field curve, 20260909217800
-- the table's refresh. The table's DDL is repeated here in IF NOT EXISTS form
-- because a LANGUAGE sql body is validated at CREATE and this file sorts first.
--
-- No index is added and no existing table is rewritten.

-- identical IF NOT EXISTS form. Until 217800's refresh has run the table is
-- empty, and an empty table admits nothing: every day-30 column is NULL,

  -- The closure arm below reads two feed-dark signals: the collector's own

  -- The exit-ledger arm read NEITHER, because job_board_exits carries no
  -- suspect column and no batch alibi -- so ageouts_90d was an uncensored
  -- numerator over a partly censored denominator, and every caller dividing
  -- one by the other published a share inflated toward the accusation. On a
  -- worked example (100 fills, 60 relists, 40 age-outs, one batch censoring 50
  -- fills and 30 relists) the published share was 33% where the true figure is
  -- 20%.
  --
  -- THE TWO LEDGERS SHARE A BATCH KEY EXACTLY, which is what makes this
  -- possible rather than approximate. One board pass computes a single
  -- `closedAt` and writes it as job_board_closures.closed_at on the takedowns
  -- AND as job_board_exits.exited_at on the age-outs of that same `vanished`
  -- set (job-board/index.ts, the aged-exit and closure-row mappers). So
  -- (company_token, exited_at) IS the closure batch key, not a proxy for one.
  --
  -- WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, STATED: a pass in which EVERY vanished posting aged
  -- out writes no closure row, so it has no suspect stamp and no batch to size,
  -- and its age-outs are not censorable from here. That direction over-counts
  -- age-outs, which is the accusing direction -- it is bounded by how rarely a
  -- whole pass is age-outs alone, and it is named here rather than implied.

  -- age-outs over a 90-day window of EXIT times while the live censored arm is
  -- one instant of the board matches 90 days of events against a single day's
  -- worth of still-open observations, so every day of the window contributes
  -- its events but only 1/W of the roles that were still open. Measured in

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.get_company_fill_curve(text[]) IS
  'Per-employer Aalen-Johansen cumulative incidence of FILL, with RELIST as a '
  'competing event and age-outs plus still-live roles as right-censored '
  'observations. COHORT: the risk set is selected on ORIGIN -- a posting is an '
  'observation when the employer stated a post date and that date falls inside '
  'the trailing 90 days -- so all three arms draw from one population and '
  'R(14) does not move with the length of the window. Selecting fills on their '
  'exit time while taking live roles from a single instant of the board matched '
  '90 days of events against one day of still-open observations and returned '
  '0.4390 on data whose true rate was 0.5000, with the truth outside its own '
  'published interval. The _90d COUNT columns are deliberately NOT cohort-'
  'scoped; they are named for a window of events and remain one. DATE BASIS: '
  'every duration is measured from the employer''s stated posted_at ALONE, '
  'never coalesced with our first_seen; undated postings contribute to counts '
  'only and their share is published as dated_coverage (deliberately NOT part '
  'of `sufficient` -- the caller renders plain at 0.60 and above, with a '
  'coverage qualifier between 0.30 and 0.60, and suppresses below 0.30). '
  'dated_coverage is measured over the WHOLE risk-set population including '
  'exit-ledger rows, so the age-out arm''s missing origins (job_board_exits.'
  'posted_at is stamped only from 2026-09-06 and cannot be backfilled -- the '
  'postings were hard-deleted) show up as LOW COVERAGE and the renderer '
  'suppresses, instead of hiding behind a coverage of 1.0000 while the hazard '
  'runs high. fill_rate_14 IS AN UPPER BOUND, not a point estimate, on any '
  'employer that relists: the collector logs one superseded closure per title '
  'per 24h and DELETES the deduped postings outright, so those competing events '
  'are absent from the risk set rather than counted in it. relist_rate_14, '
  'relists_90d and churn are the matching FLOORS and must render with an "at '
  'least" qualifier. fill_rate_14_lo/hi ARE AN APPROXIMATION, not an exact '
  'interval: Greenwood complementary log-log bounds on S are carried across to '
  'R by the observed fill share, which is exact only if that share is constant '
  'over t. median_days_to_fill is min{t <= 30 : R(t) >= 0.5} -- the median of '
  'the FILL cumulative incidence, NOT of all-cause survival, which is a '
  'deliberate departure from the frozen contract because S falls on relists as '
  'well as fills and the survival form published a 4-day "fill median" beside a '
  '10 per cent fill rate. It is NULL with median_censored TRUE whenever the fill '
  'incidence has not reached one half inside 30 days, which is most employers; '
  'render that as "more than 30 days" and never as a number, and render the '
  'number itself as "half of these roles are FILLED by day N". CENSORING SET: '
  'exit_reason aged_out, board_dormant and untracked; ''removed'' is excluded '
  'because it mirrors every closure row and would double-count each fill, and '
  '''backdated'' is excluded because those postings are left-truncated and would '
  'inflate the risk set with observations that cannot produce an event. '
  'ageouts_90d counts ''aged_out'' alone. FEED-DARK: a batch the collector '
  'stamped suspect, and any unstamped (company_token, closed_at) batch that '
  'removed more than max(5, 0.30 x the board size AT THE TIME, from the newest '
  'company snapshot at or before that day), is CENSORED rather than deleted -- '
  'it is our collection failing, not the employer, so the observations stay in '
  'the risk set and count in NONE of fills_90d, relists_90d or ageouts_90d. '
  'THE AGE-OUT ARM IS CENSORED ON THE SAME VERDICT AS OF 2026-09-08, and was '
  'not before: job_board_exits carries no suspect column and no batch alibi, so '
  'ageouts_90d was the one count in this function outside the feed-dark policy, '
  'and any caller dividing it by the three together published a share inflated '
  'toward the accusation (33% where the truth was 20% on the worked example in '
  'that migration''s header). It is reachable exactly, not approximately: one '
  'board pass writes a single instant as closed_at on its takedowns and as '
  'exited_at on its age-outs, so (company_token, exited_at) IS the closure '
  'batch key. A pass whose vanished set is age-outs ALONE writes no closure row '
  'and cannot be judged from here; that residual over-counts age-outs. Where no '
  'snapshot survives (they are pruned at 35 days, the unstamped era is about 54) '
  'the fallback is today''s served count with the absolute floor RAISED TO 25, '
  'because in that region a wind-down and a dark feed are indistinguishable and '
  'over-deleting removes the best-evidenced employers first. `sufficient` is the '
  'contract''s three conditions plus a fourth: observed relists at or before day '
  '14 must not outnumber observed fills there. absorption is the change in served open roles since '
  'the earliest company snapshot inside the window -- algebraically the same as '
  'openings minus fills, relists and age-outs, but computable, because arrivals '
  'are not logged; snapshots are pruned at 35 days, so its basis is shorter than '
  '90 days and NULL where no snapshot survives. fill_through''s L* term counts '
  'live roles at least 14 days old by effective_posted, a MEMBERSHIP test rather '
  'than a published duration, so that its numerator and denominator come from '
  'one sample. SECURITY DEFINER is not decoration: job_board_closures lost its '
  'public SELECT policy and job_board_exits never had one, so an INVOKER version '
  'would answer 200 with empty aggregates and publish silence as a fact.'
  ' ADMITTED ABSENCE BASES: full_read, lap, and NULL -- NULL is a row '
  'written before the column existed on 2026-09-08 and is a full_read '
  'closure, not an unknown one. lap_backfill is EXCLUDED and must stay '
  'excluded: it is a takedown from a big board''s FIRST observable laps, '
  'so its closed_at is the day we could finally see it and is late by an '
  'unknown amount up to the freshness window. It is a count of events, '
  'never a dated one -- see COMMENT ON COLUMN '
  'public.job_board_closures.absence_basis, and get_closure_population() '
  'for how many such rows exist. '
  'It is excluded from the risk set, from both feed-dark verdicts (the '
  'batch sizer and bad_batch, which the age-out arm censors on), and from '
  'tracking_days -- where admitting it would hand an employer we have '
  'watched for months a span of one day, its board''s first lap having '
  'produced its first logged closure this morning.'
  ' STILL ADVERTISED AT DAY 30 (still_open_30 and its siblings, added '
  '20260909217000). S(30) from the same Aalen-Johansen estimator over a SECOND '
  'cohort: postings with a stated posted_at in [cohort_from, cohort_to], where '
  'cohort_to is thirty days ago (so every member had the full thirty days to '
  'be watched) and cohort_from is GREATEST(the first whole day after now() - '
  '90 days, 2026-08-07) -- inside the same event window as the closure and '
  'exit arms, so no member can have a takedown the window cannot see. The '
  '2026-08-07 floor: '
  'job_board_exits.posted_at is stamped only from 2026-09-06, so no age-out '
  'logged earlier carries an origin and cohorts posted before 2026-08-07 are '
  'missing exactly the roles that did not close. The floor retires itself. '
  'still_open_30 is the share of that cohort still advertised when it reached '
  'our 30-day cap; taken_down_30 is the share taken down for good (R(30), a '
  'CEILING for the same relist-dedupe reason as fill_rate_14 and NOT '
  'fill_rate_30, which runs over the day-14 cohort and no gate); '
  'relist_rate_30 is the share re-listed (a FLOOR). sum_check_30 is R + X + S '
  'and is published so the identity is checked rather than asserted; '
  'sufficient_30 requires it within 1e-6, n_at_risk_30 >= 25 and a '
  'complementary-log-log half-width on S within 0.15. ageouts_at_30 counts, '
  'among the observations at risk at day 30, the ones OUR sweep took down at '
  'the cap -- our action, never an employer event. '
  'OBSERVABILITY GATE: every day-30 column is NULL -- not 1.0 -- unless '
  'observability_bucket is full_read or lap_proven, read from '
  'job_board_board_observability as refresh_closure_population() last wrote '
  'it. A windowed board with no proven lap has S(30) = 1 by construction, '
  'because its takedowns are invisible and every posting ages out. '
  'A closure never means hired; a role still advertised at day 30 is not '
  'proof of anything about the employer beyond the fact stated; nothing here '
  'extrapolates past the cap (docs/hiring-health-model.md section 10).';
